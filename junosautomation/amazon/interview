Coding and Design - Whiteboarding Guidance:
I have provided a LiveCode link for the coding session of the interview. This system will allow you to code collaboratively with your interviewer. Here’s how to launch LiveCode in your interview:
1. Click on this link to start your session: https://livecode.amazon.jobs/session/6f4c4229-4d57-4c8f-898c-70565c431f7b

         2. Enter your name (Note: The whiteboard will be locked until your interviewer opens the session)

For your design session, we have approved the following guidance:

Use a pen and paper to share designs with the interviewer through your video camera; or
Use your favorite whiteboarding app and share screen in Chime; or
If needed, we suggest using a free whiteboard web-based product such as https://awwapp.com, and share the screen through Chime.
Note: Please test any whiteboard product (and Chime) prior to the scheduled interview to make sure there is proper understanding of how it functions.
