'''
1. Speed of Code: The interviewer is going to look at how quickly you solve the problem.
Youâ€™ll want to complete the problem with a working solution in 10-15 minutes from
beginning to end.
2. Communication/Problem Solving: Before you start coding, make sure to ask clarifying
questions. Repeat the coding question back to the interviewer as well to ensure that you
are both on the same page. Walk the interviewer through your entire thought process
prior to writing out your code. Also, listen for hints or advice from the interviewer and
make sure to incorporate them.
3. Cleanliness/Optimization: The interviewer will expect you to come up with the most
optimized solution. You should run test cases and check for edge and corner cases. The
interviewer will also look for a clean, bug-free solution. Also, no pseudo-code.
4. Working Solution: The interviewer will want to see an executable working solution. You
should be able to come up with a good argument for why your solution is correct.
